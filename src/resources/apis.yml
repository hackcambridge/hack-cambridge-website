      Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford) are a set of APIs, SDKs and services available to developers to make their applications more intelligent,

      intelligent features – such as emotion and video detection; facial, speech and vision recognition; and speech and language understanding – into their
      applications. Our vision is for more personal computing experiences and enhanced productivity aided by systems that increasingly can see, hear, speak, understand
