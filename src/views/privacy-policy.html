          Information Collection and Use
      </h3>
      <p>
      While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you.

      <h3>
          Sponsors
      </h3>
      <p>
      We wouldn’t be able to organize Hack Cambridge without the help of our sponsors. Sponsors, in exchange, will have access to the CV you’ve submitted. They may perform processing on and make use of the data within the CV you have submitted for recruiting purposes, for example to send you a job offer.
      </p>
      <p>
      However, we won’t be sharing anything else from your application with sponsors. So if you want to be reached by sponsors you should put your contact details in your CV.
      </p>
      
      <h3>
          Media and Publicity
      </h3>
      <p>
      We will be taking lots of photos throughout the event, and publishing them. You may appear on some of these photos. We aim to publish photos that show everyone at their best, but there might be a few that you don’t like. If you see a photo like this, let us know so that we can try to take it down—but be aware that it is difficult to completely erase a photo from all media channels.
      </p>
      <p>
      We will publish the names of the winners and the winning hacks. We may publish other content associated with this, such as videos of the winners presenting.
      </p>
      <p>
      We may share anonymised data with media organisations for the purposes of promoting Hack Cambridge.
      </p>
