- title: 'Improbable: Probabilistic Programming with Keanu'
  description: |
      We explore how probabilistic programming lets you model the world and answer
      questions about it. Specifically, we show some examples of using Keanu to do this,
      and how you can tune your Keanu models using data and "observations".
      Finally, we explore how you might apply Keanu to our challenge, Best
      Probabilistic Game AI, by building a very simple game AI using Keanu
